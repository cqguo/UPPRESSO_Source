\title{\Large \bf {UPPRESSO}: Untraceable and Unlinkable Privacy-PREserving\\Single Sign-On Services}


\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
%As widely-adopted identity management and authentication solutions in the Internet,
Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to maintain only the credential at the identity provider (IdP), instead of one credential for each relying party (RP),
    to login to numerous RPs.
% which shifts the burden of user authentication from RPs to the IdP.
However, SSO introduces extra privacy leakage threats, compared with traditional authentication mechanisms,
 as (\emph{a}) the IdP could track all the RPs which a user is visiting,
 and (\emph{b}) collusive RPs could learn a user's online profile by linking his identities across these RPs.
Several privacy-preserving SSO solutions have been proposed to defend against either the curious IdP or collusive RPs,
 but none of them addresses both of these privacy leakage threats at the same time.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving SSO system, called \emph{UPPRESSO},
 to protect a user's login traces against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs simultaneously.
We analyze the identity dilemma between the SSO security requirements and these privacy concerns,
    and convert the SSO privacy problems into an identity-transformation challenge.
In each login instance of UPPRESSO,
    an \emph{ephemeral pseudo-identity} (denoted as $PID_{RP}$) of the RP which the user is attempting to visit,
        is firstly negotiated between the RP and the user.
Then,
    $PID_{RP}$ is sent to the IdP and designated in the identity token,
        so that the IdP is not aware of the visited RP.
Meanwhile,
    $PID_{RP}$ is used by the IdP to transform the \emph{permanent user identity} $ID_U$
        into an \emph{ephemeral user pseudo-identity} (denoted as $PID_U$)
        in the identity token.
%Then, we design a novel {\em transformed RP designation} scheme to transform the identifier of the RP, to which the user requests to log in, into a privacy-preserving pseudo-identity ($PID_{RP}$) through the cooperation between the user and the RP.
On receiving the identity token,
    the RP transforms $PID_U$ into a \emph{permanent account} (denoted as $Acct$) of the user, by a trapdoor in the negotiation.
%Our {\em trapdoor user identification} scheme allows the RP to obtain a trapdoor from the transformation process and use it to derive a permanent account of the user at that RP from his privacy-preserving pseudo-identity ($PID_U$) generated by the IdP.
Given a user, the account at each RP is unique and different from $ID_U$,
    so collusive RPs cannot link his identities across multiple RPs.
To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first practical SSO solution which solves the privacy problems caused by both the curious IdP and collusive RPs.

We build the UPPRESSO prototype system for web applications,
    with standard functions of OpenID Connect (OIDC):
     the function of RP Dynamic Registration is used to support ephemeral $PID_{RP}$,
     while the function of Core Sign-On is slightly modified to calculate $PID_U$ and $Acct$.
The prototype system is implemented on top of open-source MITREid Connect,
    and the extensive evaluation shows that UPPRESSO introduces reasonable overheads
        and fulfills the requirements of both security and privacy.


%The sign-on process of UPPRESSO follows the service pattern of OpenID Connect (OIDC) with minimum modifications, and UPPRESSO is platform-independent. Our analysis shows that UPPRESSO provides comprehensive privacy protection while achieving the same security guarantees as OIDC.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
